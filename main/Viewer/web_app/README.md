# Project README.md

## Project Overview

Welcome to my Research Data Analysis Screening Tool! This web application, powered by Django, is designed to streamline the screening process for research data analysis. Its distinctive features include the ability to handle specialized .txt files, empowering researchers to efficiently screen thousands of articles. The application facilitates easy access to screened articles with just a click, making it an invaluable tool for researchers managing large datasets.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

My project sets itself apart by focusing on the unique needs of researchers dealing with extensive datasets. The use of Django ensures a robust and scalable framework, while the distinctiveness lies in the application's capability to handle and analyze large volumes of data. The complexity of the project is evident in its features, such as user authentication, file upload and display, and the ability to effortlessly manage and access thousands of articles.

## Functionality

### 1. Efficient Screening

The web application is tailored for researchers dealing with large datasets. It allows users to upload thousands of articles in .txt format, providing a convenient way to screen and analyze research data quickly.

### 2. Seamless Access

Once articles are screened, the application offers a user-friendly interface to access them with a single click. Researchers can easily navigate through the analyzed articles, making the retrieval process swift and intuitive.

### 3. User Authentication

To ensure data security and personalized access, the application includes user authentication. Researchers can create accounts, log in securely, and change passwords as needed, adding an extra layer of protection to sensitive research data.

## How to Run the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `/project` directory.

2. Run the Django development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

4. Explore the functionality using the provided sample .txt files.
